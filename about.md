## Fun Facts About Me

1. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. I moved to Toronto 6 years ago.
2. I'm so tiny. When my dog stands on hind legs, basically we have the same height. :-p
3. I love GREEN/GOLD COLOURED ITEMS. You can always find something green or gold around me.
4. I like to try new things. Learning new languages, tasting new wines, trying new restaurants/foods, and buying new things(of course!)...etc.
5. I was a flower shop manager in downtown Toronto before joining the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs(pre-COVID 19). **Tip💡** There are many romantic flowers that area’t red roses :-p.
